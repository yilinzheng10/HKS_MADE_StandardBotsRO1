# ROS Realtime API
Sample code to call the ROS2 APIs.  By default we use cyclone dds implementation for the ROS2 networking.  Additionally, we use `ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1` to expose the topics

# Robot Setup

1. Clear any errors on the move page 
1. Enable the ROS2 API and ROS2 Bridge features from the Standard Bots app 
   - Click menu -> Settings -> Configure Developer API
   - If "Configure Developer API" is missing, reach out to Standard Bots and we can enable it for you.
   - Turn the `Enable Developer API` on.  This enables the python / REST API
   - Turn the `Enable ROS2 bridge` on.  This enables the ROS2 topics to be published on the local network.

# Client Setup

Next, we set up the client side to talk to the robot.  First you'll need to setup a machine on the *same network* that the robot is currently on.  Ethernet is preferred, but wifi will work as well.

Next, we require docker to run the sample code.  We use docker to set up the ROS environment so that it can communication over the ROS2 protocols

## Pull repository

Download this repository on your machine.  

`git clone git@github.com:standardbots/ros2-realtime-api.git`

## Building

1. Update the `cyclonedds.xml` `<NetworkInterface>` `name` attribute to the adapter you will be using.  This adapter should be on the same network that the control box is on
  - For example if your adapter is named `eth0` change the line to this`<NetworkInterface name="eth0" priority="0" presence_required="true" />`
1. Build the docker image

```
./build.sh
```

## Running

### Run the default script

```
./run.sh
```

The default script will auto detect the bot id and then just read and print out the default joint states

### Run a different script

#### Print out the auto detected bot id

```
./run.sh python3 ./src/detect_bot_id.py
```

#### Read the joint states

```
./run.sh python3 ./src/read_joint_states.py
```

#### Move the robot down from current position

We need to explicitly use the SDK to unbrake and enable the ROS2, so we need the url and api token.
These can be obtained from the developer api menu, under menu -> settings -> configure developer api

```
./run.sh python3 ./src/write_poses.py --bot-id=<BOT_ID> --token=<TOKEN> --url=<REMOTE_ROBOT_URL>
```

## Run a shell in docker environement

You can also run an interactive shell in the docker container.  It will automatically set the correct permissions and set the domain id, as well as mount the current directory into the container.  You can use this iteratively develop a script while running an set up environment

1. `./run_shell.sh`

### List the ROS2 topics
1. `ros2 topic list`

### Run a script
1. `python3 ./src/read_joint_states.py --bot-id=<ROBOT_ID>`
